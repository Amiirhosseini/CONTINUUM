"""Forward-only schema migration for the SQLite storage engine.

CONTINUUM stamps every database with a ``schema_version`` in ``continuum_meta``
and refuses to open one it cannot understand. Historically that refusal was
fail-closed in *both* directions: a database written by an older build raised
``SchemaVersionError`` with no remedy but "reset the database". This module
replaces that with a forward-migration runner:

* A brand-new database is seeded with the current ``BASELINE_SCHEMA`` and
  recorded at ``SCHEMA_VERSION``.
* A database stamped with an *older* version is moved forward one version at a
  time, applying each registered migration, until it reaches
  ``SCHEMA_VERSION``. Every applied step is recorded in ``schema_migrations`` so
  the path a database took is auditable.
* A database stamped with a *newer* version (written by a build this one cannot
  downgrade to) still raises ``SchemaVersionError`` -- we never silently open a
  schema we do not understand. A gap with no registered migration also raises,
  so an unrecognized older shape fails closed rather than being guessed at.

All migrations are additive (``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` / ``ALTER TABLE ...
ADD COLUMN``), which is what makes forward motion safe and replayable.
